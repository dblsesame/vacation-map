# Project 5 Neighborhood Map 

The goal of this project is to build a single page application using google map.  I have chosen Turks & Caicos island where I wish to spent some vacation time in the future.  I have implemented this app using the Knockout framework to handle the data binding and filtering of the list of points of interest.  The third-party APIs are used to provide more information for a given point of interest.  I used the Wikipedia API, Google Street View API and the Foursquare API. I then used off-canvas pattern to show/hide the list to achieve responsive web design.

## How does it work

The map can be accessed in the following URL:
http://dblsesame.github.io/vacation-map/

or you can download the github repository and open the index.html in the browser.

Typing in the filter text box will filter the list as well as the map markers on the map.

Click on the list or the marker will display a infowindow with more information about the location.
